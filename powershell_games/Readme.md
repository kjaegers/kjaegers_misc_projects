# PowerShell Games

I use PowerShell for lots of professional work, but I also dabble in game development. PowerShell is likely the most inappropriate environment for writing games, but it isn't impossible :)

## The Games

**PowerKong** - A text-mode implementation of a __very simplistic__ tribute to the Donkey Kong arcade game

**Match3** - A jewel matching 3-in-a-row game - just like the 332434 mobile games out there

**Snake** - The classic growing snake eating apples game
